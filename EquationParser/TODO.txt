- Parametric equations?
- When 0 * inf: return array of all z in range
	+ Needs to be handled differently in operations higher in tree. Maybe return "all"
	  and if v1.eval == "all" or v2.eval "all": return "all"
	  - Then in equation: if operation.eval == "all" return self.all
- Implement exp()
